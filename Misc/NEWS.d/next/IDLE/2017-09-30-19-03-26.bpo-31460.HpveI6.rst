Simplify the API of IDLE's Module Browser.

Passing a widget instead of an flist with a root widget opens the option of
creating a browser frame that is only part of a window.  Passing a full file
name instead of pieces assumed to come from a .py file opens the possibility
of browsing python files that do not end in .py.
